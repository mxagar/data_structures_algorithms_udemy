# Python for Algorithms, Data-Structures, and Interviews

This repository contains a compilation of algorithm & data structure implementations in python. I forked it originally from a repository by J.M. Portilla, who has a Udemy course on the topic:

[Python for Algorithms, Data-Structures, and Interviews](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-structures-algorithms-and-interviews)

I added comments and alternative implementations in some cases.

:warning: This repository is some kind of sandbox where I try things, so if don't expect it to be tidy and 100% PEP8-compliant :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:.

The present file is a non-exhaustive guide of the repository and the course.

Another related repository of mine is [python_interviews](https://github.com/mxagar/python_interviews). I created that repository while following the course / learning path [Ace the Python Coding Interview](https://www.educative.io/path/ace-python-coding-interview) in [educative.io](educative.io).
