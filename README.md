# Python for Algorithms, Data-Structures, and Interviews

This repository contains a compilation of algorithms & data structures and their implementations in Python. I forked it originally from a repository by J.M. Portilla, who has a Udemy course on the topic:

[Python for Algorithms, Data-Structures, and Interviews](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-structures-algorithms-and-interviews)

Additionally, I added comments and alternative implementations, in some cases after checking other resources, such as (always referenced):

- Educative: [Ace the Python Coding Interview](https://www.educative.io/path/ace-python-coding-interview)
- DataCamp: [Writing Efficient Python Code](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/writing-efficient-python-code)
- Cousera: [Accelerated Computer Science Fundamentals Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cs-fundamentals); check my notes on the Specialization: [mxagar/accelerated_computer_science_coursera](https://github.com/mxagar/accelerated_computer_science_coursera).

**A non-exasutive *guide* with notes can be found in [`Python_DSAlgo_Guide.md`](Python_DSAlgo_Guide.md).**

Another related repository of mine is [design_patterns_notes](https://github.com/mxagar/design_patterns_notes). I created that repository while following the Udemy course [Design Patterns in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-patterns-python/) by Dmitri Nesteruk.
