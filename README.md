# Python for Algorithms, Data-Structures, and Interviews

This repository contains a compilation of algorithm & data structure implementations in python. I forked it originally from a repository by J.M. Portilla, who has a Udemy course on the topic:

[Python for Algorithms, Data-Structures, and Interviews](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-structures-algorithms-and-interviews)

I added comments and alternative implementations in some cases.
