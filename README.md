# Python for Algorithms, Data-Structures, and Interviews

This repository contains a compilation of algorithm & data structure implementations in python. I forked it originally from a repository by J.M. Portilla, who has a Udemy course on the topic:

[Python for Algorithms, Data-Structures, and Interviews](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-structures-algorithms-and-interviews)

I added comments and alternative implementations in some cases.

:warning: This repository is some kind of sandbox where I try things, so if ddon't expect things to be tidy and 100% PEP8-compliant :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:.

A non-exasutive *guide* with notes can be found in [`Python_DSAlgo_Guide.md`](Python_DSAlgo_Guide.md).
